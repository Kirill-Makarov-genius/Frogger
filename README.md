# Frogger
A simple handmade Frogger. In this game I use only vanilla JavaScript. 
1. Field is a array of squares, so when we want to move frog only what we need to do is change it index
2. Animation implemented by changing the class of element and setInterval
3. Every 100 ms determine where the frog and obstacles are to define result of the game
4. Manage of frog implemented by event "keyup" which read what key I am pushed
